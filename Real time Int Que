How can we define a multibranching strategy in Jenkins?
How can we trigger a Jenkins pipeline, and what are the different triggering methods?
What best practices should be followed when integrating GitHub with Jenkins?
What is a hosted stage in Jenkins?
In a Jenkinsfile, if a user wants to change the credentials every time, how can we assign them without hardcoding?
If the code passes in a Jenkins pipeline and gets deployed but later encounters issues in production during testing, how can we resolve the issue?
What challenges have you faced in DevOps operations, and how did you resolve them?
What new frameworks would you suggest to the development team for deployment or code building?
How can we check the code health status in GitHub only?
EKS/Kubernetes
What is a Kubernetes Probe?
What is the difference between a Kubernetes Deployment and a DaemonSet?
How can deployments be managed in Kubernetes?
How do you update the version in EKS, and how will it affect the nodes and pods?
If an application is deployed in Kubernetes and needs to connect to an RDS instance, how can it establish a connection from Pods/Nodes?
How can AWS Lambda logs be stored in an EKS cluster?
How can we upgrade an EKS cluster without affecting application deployments?
If a UI-based application is deployed in Kubernetes and accessible via a URL, how can we deploy it in Kubernetes, and how will the backend API respond?
AWS Services (EC2, RDS, Lambda, S3, IAM, Networking, Security, Cost Optimization, CloudFormation)
EC2
If an EC2 instance is in a private subnet and needs to send data to an S3 bucket, how can it connect to the S3 bucket?
If a resource is in a private subnet and cannot be accessed, how can it be accessed?
If a PEM key is lost or deleted, how can we connect to an EC2 instance?
RDS & Databases
How is authentication provided to database end users, and how do they access it?
How can a large number of users in IAM be handled?
How can a database server be set up for disaster recovery (DR), and what strategies are commonly used?
How do you choose the right database based on requirements?
How can database backup data be stored in AWS?
How can data transfer costs be reduced if AWS Cost Gateway Hub has led to increased expenses?
How can database costs be optimized for unused data that may be needed in the future, and how can the database be resized to save costs?
If a database needs to be upgraded to the latest version without data loss, how can this be achieved?
How can we optimize and improve the performance of an RDS database?
How does DynamoDB work, how is its cost allocated, and how can we reduce DynamoDB costs?
If an application is deployed in Kubernetes and needs to connect to an RDS instance, how can it establish a connection from Pods/Nodes?
If an RDS database is hosted in a private subnet in AWS and users from an on-premises network need access, how can they connect?
Lambda
What is AWS Lambda invocation, and how does it work?
When should you use AWS Lambda instead of an EC2 instance, and vice versa?
How can a Lambda function be triggered?
S3 & CloudFront
What are the best practices for deploying to Amazon S3?
In CloudFront, S3 is the endpoint. What other endpoints can be used?
IAM & Multi-Account Management
A customer requires a Jenkins server deployed in one AWS account, but the same server’s pipelines need to connect to another account in the same region. How can we establish this connection securely?
If I have a user who needs to access all accounts, how can they use AWS SSO (Single Sign-On)?
I have multiple accounts, and I want to monitor the resources for each user. How can I achieve this?
How can I create a cost optimization budget, set up a dashboard, and monitor costs in AWS? Additionally, how do I set up an AWS Organization and manage IAM within the organization?
Networking (VPC, Load Balancing, API Exposure)
If my web-based application is hosted on a private subnet, how can I access it from outside the subnet?
Can VPC peering be done between accounts? In how many ways can we establish a connection between two networks?
If an NLB has a static IP address and an ALB has a dynamic IP address, can we assign a static IP address to the ALB?
How can an API be exposed to the internet?
CloudFormation
If a CloudFormation stack fails and rolls back after one hour, how can we troubleshoot and resolve the issue?
Cost Optimization & Monitoring
How can data be secured in AWS services?
How can I reduce the size of a logical disk on a Linux machine when it is sometimes unused, to save costs?
DevOps & Security
How can a 404 error in an application be resolved at the application level?
If a UI-based application is deployed in Kubernetes and accessible via a URL, how can we deploy it in Kubernetes, and how will the backend API respond?
How can application vulnerabilities be checked in AWS, and which tools can be used for this?
If a web application is hosted, how can we secure it, and what security measures can we apply without using third-party tools?
Docker
What is a Docker multi-stage build, and how does it work?
What is the difference between the ADD and COPY commands in a Dockerfile, and how do the CMD and ENV commands differ?
Architecture & Design
How can I design a 3-tier architecture in AWS Cloud? What is the process?
How do you design a solution for an AWS microservices application or migrate an application to AWS?
Can you provide a brief overview of microservices architecture?
What is an AWS Landing Zone, and how is it configured in AWS?
What is Databricks, and how does its environment work?
